# nn.h
nn.h is a header only C library I wrote when learning about basic ML, and gradient descent in particular.
The goal of nn.h was not to implement what I learned by reading about the conventional way to do ML, but rather to experiment, and learn by JUST DO-IT-ing.
I started with the most basic task of linear regression and from there the library evolved to a Neural Network trainer :D
Achieving that, required a LOT of derivating, which were used in order to find the general partial derivative of the COST function, with regards to any parameter in the Neural Network.
All this _science_ is found in a `.pdf` file I wrote in English and in my poor _français_.

The project also contains a few basic examples of Neural Networks that I trained using the library, but none of them are incredibly exciting ATM.
